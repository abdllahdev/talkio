/**
 * Actor Logic Exports
 *
 * Central export point for all XState callback actors used by the agent state machine.
 *
 * These actors are registered in the agent machine setup and handle different
 * aspects of the voice conversation:
 * - `sttActor` - Speech-to-text transcription
 * - `vadActor` - Voice activity detection (optional)
 * - `turnDetectorActor` - Turn boundary detection (optional)
 * - `llmActor` - Language model response generation
 * - `ttsActor` - Text-to-speech synthesis
 * - `audioStreamerActor` - Audio output streaming
 *
 * Each actor is implemented as an XState callback actor that communicates
 * with the state machine via events.
 *
