/**
 * Deepgram Provider Factory
 *
 * Main factory function for creating a Deepgram provider instance with shared settings.
 *
 * This module provides a convenient way to create both STT and TTS providers
 * that share the same configuration (API key, base URL, etc.). The returned
 * provider instance has factory methods (`stt()` and `tts()`) for creating
 * individual providers with shared or overridden settings.
 *
 * **Usage Pattern**:
 * 1. Create a Deepgram provider instance with shared settings
 * 2. Use the factory methods to create STT and TTS providers
 * 3. Pass the providers to `createAgent()`
 *
 * This approach is useful when you want to use both Deepgram STT and TTS
 * with the same API key and base URL, reducing configuration duplication.

 * The returned provider has factory methods for creating STT and TTS providers

 *
 * @param settings - Optional provider settings (API key, base URL)
 *   These settings are used as defaults for individual STT/TTS providers.
 *   Individual providers can override these settings.
 * @returns Deepgram provider instance with `stt()` and `tts()` factory methods
 *
 * @example Basic usage
 * ```typescript
 * import { createDeepgram } from "@vox/deepgram";
 *
 * const deepgram = createDeepgram({
 *   apiKey: process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY,
 * });
 *
 * const agent = createAgent({
 *   stt: deepgram.stt({ model: "nova-3" }),
 *   tts: deepgram.tts({ model: "aura-2-thalia-en" }),
 *   llm: myLLMProvider,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example With custom base URL
 * ```typescript
 * const deepgram = createDeepgram({
 *   apiKey: process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY,
 *   baseUrl: "api.deepgram.com", // Custom base URL for enterprise/proxy
 * });
 * ```
