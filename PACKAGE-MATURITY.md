# Package Maturity Model

Talkio packages follow a maturity progression that helps users understand the readiness of each package and guides contributors on how to help.

## Maturity Levels

### Level 1: Vibe-Engineered

Initial implementation, typically AI-assisted or created rapidly to prove out the API surface.

**Criteria:**

- Implements core functionality (orchestration, provider interfaces, or provider implementation)
- Has comprehensive test coverage (unit and integration tests)
- Has basic documentation (README with installation and usage examples)
- Published to npm registry
- TypeScript types are complete and accurate

**What this means for users:**

- API may change based on ecosystem feedback
- Suitable for prototyping and non-critical workloads
- May have rough edges or non-idiomatic patterns
- Community feedback actively sought
- Breaking changes may occur in minor versions

**How to level up:**

- Get a TypeScript/voice AI expert to review the implementation
- Incorporate idiomatic patterns and best practices
- Address any API ergonomics issues
- Improve error handling and edge case coverage
- Add performance benchmarks and optimization

---

### Level 2: Expert-Reviewed

A TypeScript or voice AI expert has reviewed and improved the implementation.

**Criteria:**

- All Level 1 criteria, plus:
- Reviewed by someone with significant experience
- API follows TypeScript idioms and conventions
- Error handling follows ecosystem best practices
- Documentation includes idiomatic examples and common patterns
- Performance characteristics are reasonable for the use case
- Comprehensive edge case handling (interruptions, timeouts, cancellation)
- Clear migration guides for breaking changes

**What this means for users:**

- API is stable and idiomatic
- Suitable for production use with appropriate testing
- Implementation quality is on par with other ecosystem libraries
- Maintainers understand the domain deeply enough to handle issues
- Breaking changes follow semantic versioning strictly

**How to level up:**

- Get adoption from real-world users
- Address issues and feedback from production usage
- Build a track record of stability
- Add framework integrations or adapters
- Establish community support channels

---

### Level 3: Production-Proven

Widespread usage in production environments with a track record of stability.

**Criteria:**

- All Level 2 criteria, plus:
- Used in production by multiple organizations
- Has survived real-world edge cases and failure modes
- Stable API with semantic versioning
- Responsive maintenance (issues addressed, security patches)
- May have framework integrations (e.g., Express middleware, Next.js adapters)
- Performance benchmarks and optimization documented
- Active community and clear contribution guidelines

**What this means for users:**

- Battle-tested implementation
- Confident choice for critical workloads
- Active community and maintenance
- Long-term support expectations
- Production-ready for enterprise use

## Versioning and Stability

All packages follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Level 1 packages**: May have breaking changes in minor versions (0.x.y or alpha versions)
- **Level 2+ packages**: Follow semver strictly after 1.0.0

We recommend Level 1 packages pin exact versions and Level 2+ packages use compatible version ranges.
